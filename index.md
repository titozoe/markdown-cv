## Currently

Software developer with 15 years experience:

Experienced in designing and implementing robust ETL solutions, with a strong focus on code quality, maintainability, and reusability. I support both public and private sector clients by delivering the features they need reliably and efficiently.

Passionate about continuous learning and always looking for ways to improve both personally and within the team. I enjoy tackling challenging tasks and find great satisfaction in being helpful, especially when supporting teammates on complex problems.

A strong advocate of pair programming, which I believe fosters fast knowledge sharing and leads to more effective, higher-quality solutions.

While I recognize the potential of AI tools, I see them as complementary; I prefer not to rely on them as a crutch to deliver quality work.
